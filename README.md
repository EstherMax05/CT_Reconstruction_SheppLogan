# CT_Reconstruction_SheppLogan
This is an example of a method used by computed tomography scanners to reconstruct images called back projection. Each back-projected image is stitched together to form a sinogram. Each column of pixels in the sinogram represents the sum of the pixels through which the x-ray passes. The sinogram is then used to reconstruct the image.
